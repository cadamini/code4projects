# Getting Started with Kubernetes

This is the first article of the **Getting Started with Kubernetes** article series. In this article, I would like to give you a brief introduction to Kubernetes. This will be the first step to show you how to deploy applications on it.

## What is Kubernetes?

According to the official website:

> _Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery._

Kubernetes helps you to deploy a containerized application on a cluster and manage its life cycle.

Manage the life cycle of a modern application is a big challenge for developers because it could be composed of several microservices deployed in a distributed way on a cluster. When the number of these micro-services grows the management would be cumbersome.

In this context orchestrator like Kubernetes become indispensable, because it makes sure those micro-services run where and when you want.
