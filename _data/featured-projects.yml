    This is the <b>Getting started with Kubernetes</b> article series. In it I would like to give you a brief introduction to Kubernetes.
    I will explain What Kubernetes is, its architecture, the concepts of Pod, Replication Controller, ReplicaSets, Deployment, ConfigMaps,
    SecretMaps, etc. I will show you how to setup a Kubernetes cluster using Virtual Box and Vagrant and how to deploy an "Hello K8s!" dockerized
    application in it. <a href="getting-started-with-kubernetes.html">Check out the article series here</a>.
