  - feature-title: Getting Started with Docker
    feature-text: >
      This is the <b>Getting started with Docker</b> article series. In it I would like to explain what Docker is and how I use it in my day by 
      day job. To make this series more practical, I will show you how to write your first “Hello World!” containerized application. 
      Then, I will show you how to install PostgreSQL in a container and use it as a service. I will discuss about how the networking 
      layer works in Docker and we will configure three PostgreSQL containers to work in cluster. Finally, we will use Docker Compose 
      to simplify the deployment and complete our journey. <a href="getting-started-with-docker">Check out the article series here</a>.
